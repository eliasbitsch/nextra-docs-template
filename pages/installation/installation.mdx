# Preparation
The following introduction shows how to use the docker container on Linux and on Windows.   
Note that it is not possible to communicate with other hosts (e.g. Turtlebot) via wifi nor lan if you use docker on Windows.

## Virtualization

- Enable virtualization in your PC's BIOS/UEFI settings if needed.

## Windows

1. Install WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2):
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator
   - Run the following command:

     ```powershell filename="powershell" copy
     wsl --install
     ```
   - Restart your computer after the installation is complete.
   - When you first launch WSL2, you'll be prompted to create a username and password for your Linux distribution.

   - You'll be prompted to enter the password you created during the WSL2 setup.

2. Install docker and make sure it is running (here are the instructions: [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) [Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) )

3. Install VcXsrv as X11-Server: [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/files/latest/download)   
Make sure that you allow VcXsrv access to public and private networks

4. Start VcXsrv (XLaunch) with following configuration:   

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/XmingConfig.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={500} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>

5. Download and extract the folder `Docker-ROS` for setting up ROS in Docker: [FHTW Docker-ROS](https://github.com/TW-Robotics/Docker-ROS/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

6. Copy the downloaded files to a destination of your choice. e.g. ~/Documents/Docker/FHTW/

7. Double klick on `run_docker_from_hub.bat`

8. You should see a terminal window with the following content:   

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/terminal.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={500} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>

`Congratulations! ðŸ¥³` You have successfully set up the Docker container on Windows.

## Linux

1. Install docker and make sure it is running (here are the instructions: [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) [Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) )

2. Open a Terminal and install Git:
```bash filename="bash" copy
sudo apt-get update
```
```bash filename="bash" copy
sudo apt-get install git
```

3. Clone the repository.
```bash filename="bash" copy
git clone https://github.com/TW-Robotics/Docker-ROS.git
```

4. Navigate to the folder.
```bash filename="bash" copy
cd Docker-ROS
```

5. Start the script.
```bash filename="bash" copy
bash run_docker_from_hub.sh
```
`Congratulations! ðŸ¥³` You have successfully set up the Docker container on Linux.


## Development inside the Docker Container

To make it easier to develop within the docker container, a folder "./catkin_ws/src/" (which must be located directly in the folder from which you run the run_docker_from_hub/local) is created. This folder is mounted into the docker container to "/home/fhtw_user/catkin_ws/src/fhtw". This allows you to save your projects on your host computer and execute them in the docker container.   

## Develop with Docker in VS Code

To streamline development inside Docker containers, Visual Studio Code offers two key extensions: **Docker** and **Remote Development**. These extensions allow you to attach to running containers and develop directly inside them.

### Step 1: Install the Docker Extension

First, install the Docker extension for managing and interacting with Docker containers:

1. Install and open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar (on the left-hand side), or press `Ctrl + Shift + X`.
3. Search for **Docker** and install the extension provided by Microsoft.
4. Restart VS Code if needed.

### Step 2: Install the Remote Development Extension

To enable full development inside containers, install the **Remote Development** extension pack:

1. In the Extensions view (`Ctrl + Shift + X`), search for **Remote Development**.
2. Install the following extension pack, which includes:
   - **Remote - Containers**
   - **Remote - SSH**
   - **Remote - WSL**
   - **ROS (ms-iot.vscode-ros)**
   - **C++ Intellisense (austin.code-gnu-global)**
3. Restart VS Code to apply the changes.

### Step 3: Attach VS Code to a Running Docker Container

Once both extensions are installed, follow these steps to attach VS Code to your running Docker container:

1. Ensure your Docker container is running.
2. Open the **Docker** panel from the Activity Bar on the left-hand side in VS Code.
3. Under the **Containers** section, locate your running container.
4. Right-click on the container and select **Attach Visual Studio Code** from the context menu.


<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/vscode.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={500} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>


### Step 4: Start Developing Inside the Container

VS Code will now open a new window connected to the running Docker container, allowing you to:

- Access, edit, and save files inside the container.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/folders.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={500} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>

- Use the integrated terminal within the container environment. Â´Ctrl + Shift + Ã¶`

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/vs_terminal.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={500} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>

As you can see, you are maybe root user in the terminal. To change to the fhtw_user use the following command:
```bash filename="bash" copy
bash /ros_entrypoint.sh
```

- Now you are the fhtw_user and can use the terminal as usual.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/fhtw_user.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={500} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>
To split the terminal window you can use `Ctrl + Shift + 5` again. But don't forget to change to the fhtw_user again with `bash /ros_entrypoint.sh
`.


- Utilize VS Code's debugging and other tools directly in the container.

This setup ensures a seamless development experience within a consistent containerized environment, especially when working with complex dependencies like ROS.


## TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer)
Further to work with multiple terminals inside docker we recommend using [tmux](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/a-tmux-crash-course) which is set as the default shell.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/tmux.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={500} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>

## Commit changes to the docker container
To store changes (such as newly installed software) you need to commit these changes from your command line (we recommand powershell for windows and the normal terminal for linux).
```bash filename="bash" copy
docker commit [CONTAINER_ID] fhtw_ros_local:latest -m "Commit message"
```
