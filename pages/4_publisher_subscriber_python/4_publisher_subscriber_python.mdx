## Summary 
Estimated time to completion: 1'5 hours

**Simulated robot:** Turtlebot 3 Burger

### What will you learn with this unit?

- What are ROS topics and how to manage them
- What are topic messages and how they work
- What is a publisher/subscriber and how to create one
- Debugging tools

## What are ROS Topics: Publisher & Subscriber?

### Topic Publisher

We will continue to use the `first_pkg` package that we created in the previous unit.

1. Create a new Python executable in the `src` folder of the package named `points_publisher.py`.

```bash filename="bash" copy
roscd && cd ../src/fhtw/first_pkg/src && touch points_publisher.py
```

```bash filename="bash" copy
chmod +x points_publisher.py
```

2. With `ls` you can checj if a script is executable. It should be displayed in green and is maybe bold.
```bash filename="bash" copy
ls
```
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/green_script.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={800} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>

3. Paste the following code into `points_publisher.py`:

```python filename="python" showLineNumbers copy
#!/usr/bin/python3
import numpy as np
import rospy        # Import the Python library for ROS
from std_msgs.msg import String      # Import the String message from the std_msgs package

rospy.init_node('points_publisher')        # Initiate a Node named 'points_publisher'
pub = rospy.Publisher('/points', String, queue_size=1)  # Create a Publisher object, that will publish on the /points topic messages of type Int32

rate = rospy.Rate(2)        # Set a publish rate of 2 Hz
house_points = String()     # Create a variable of type String
counter = 0                 # Create a counter
house = "Gryffindor"

while not rospy.is_shutdown():  # Create a loop that will go until the program is stopped
  house_points.data = "{} points for {}!".format(counter, house)             # Initialize the data part of the variable
  pub.publish(house_points)     # Publish the message house_points to the topic /points
  counter += 1                  # Increase the counter

  rate.sleep()                  # Sleep for the desired rate (2)
```

So, in essence, this code **initiates a node and creates a topic on which a sequence of messages (String) on the `/points` topic.**

To summarize: **A publisher is a node that publishes a (number of) message(s) on a topic.**

So now... what is a topic?

**A topic is a channel that acts as a pipe (connection) for all ROS nodes to either publish or subscribe information (msgs) from.** Now let's look at some commands that relate to topics (some of which you've already used).



### Compile the Code

1. Go to the catkin_ws:
```bash filename="bash" copy
roscd && cd ..
```
2. Build the package:
```bash filename="bash" copy
catkin_make
```
3. Source the workspace:
```bash filename="bash" copy
source devel/setup.bash
```
4. Check if the package is in the workspace: 
```bash filename="bash" copy 
rospack profile
```

### Running the Publisher

Execute the following lines in `2 different terminals`:

1. In one Terminal start the `roscore`:
```bash filename="bash" copy
roscore
```
2. Then with `[ctrl + b] and [Shift + 5]` open a new terminal and run the publisher:
```bash filename="bash" copy
rosrun first_pkg points_publisher.py
```

**Nothing happening?** Well... that's not actually true! We just created a topic named `/points`, and published through it as an integer that increases indefinitely. Let's check this out.

A topic is like a pipe. Nodes use topics to publish information for other nodes so that they can communicate. You can find out, at any time, the number of topics in the system by doing a `rostopic list`. You can also check for a specific topic.

3. Open another terminal (`[ctrl + b] and [Shift + 2]`) and type:

```bash filename="bash" copy
rostopic list
```

Now check for a topic named `/points`.

4. To request **information** about a topic type the following command in a terminal:

```bash filename="bash" copy
rostopic info /points
```

The output will look something like this:

```bash filename="output:"
Type: std_msgs/String

Publishers:
 * /points_publisher (http://192.168.0.3:47971/)

Subscribers: None
```

The output indicates the type of the message (`std_msgs/String`), the node (`/points_publisher`) that is publishing this information, and if there is a node listening (subscribing) to this topic.

6. Now, type in a terminal:

```bash filename="bash" copy
rostopic echo /points
```

Check the output of the topic in real-time. The output will look something like this:

```bash filename="ouput:"
data: "130 points for Gryffindor!"
---
data: "131 points for Gryffindor!"
---
data: "132 points for Gryffindor!"
```

You've learned that a **topic** is a **channel where nodes can either write or read information.** You've also seen that you can **publish (write) data** onto a topic **using a publisher**.

## Subscriber

So we just learned about publishers which publish data (messages) onto a topic. Now you might be thinking that if it is possible to write data on a topic we must also be able to read data from a topic ... and you are absolutely right.

To do that we must create a subscriber on a topic.

1. Create a new Python executable in the `src` folder of our package and name it `points_subscriber.py`.

```bash filename="bash" copy
roscd && cd ../src/fhtw/first_pkg/src && touch points_subscriber.py
```

2. Make also sure that the script is executable: 
```bash filename="bash" copy  
chmod +x points_subscriber.py
```

Paste the following code into `points_subscriber.py` file:

```python filename="python" showLineNumbers copy
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String

# Define a function called 'callback' that receives a parameter named 'msg'
def callback(msg):
    string_with_points = msg.data
    # Print the 'msg'
    rospy.loginfo("{} Dumbledore shouted".format(string_with_points))
# Initiate a Node called 'topic_subscriber'
rospy.init_node('counter_subscriber')
# Create a Subscriber object that will listen to the /points
# topic and will call the 'callback' function each time it receives
# a String from the topic
sub = rospy.Subscriber('/points', String, callback)
# Create a loop that will keep the program in execution
rospy.spin()
```

### Execute the Subscriber:

1. Start the `roscore` in a terminal if it is not already running:
```bash filename="bash" copy
roscore
```

In a new terminal (`[ctrl + b] and [Shift + 5]`) type:
```bash filename="bash" copy
rosrun first_pkg points_publisher.py
```

In another new terminal (`[ctrl + b] and [Shift + 2]`) type:
```bash filename="bash" copy
rosrun first_pkg points_subscriber.py
```

The output of the terminal where you started the subscriber should look something like this:

```bash filename="output:"
fhtw_user:~/$ rosrun first_pkg points_subscriber.py
[INFO] [1625150306.760391]: "1 points for Gryffindor!" Dumbledore shouted
[INFO] [1625150307.260223]: "2 points for Gryffindor!" Dumbledore shouted
[INFO] [1625150307.760462]: "3 points for Gryffindor!" Dumbledore shouted
[INFO] [1625150308.260736]: "4 points for Gryffindor!" Dumbledore shouted
[INFO] [1625150308.760445]: "5 points for Gryffindor!" Dumbledore shouted
[INFO] [1625150309.260435]: "6 points for Gryffindor!" Dumbledore shouted
```

Now let's explain what just happened. You basically created a subscriber node that listens for the `/points` topic, and every time it receives a message, it calls a function (`callback`) that prints a string to the screen. Initially, nothing happened because no node was publishing on the `/points` topic, but when you executed `rosrun first_pkg points_publisher.py`, data (messages) were published to the `/points` topic. It all makes sense now, doesn't it? Remember that another way to read the data on a topic is: `rostopic echo /topic`

## Messages in ROS

As you may have noticed, topics process information via messages. There are many types of messages.

In the case of the code you ran earlier, the message type was `std_msgs/String`, but ROS provides many other messages. You can even create your own messages, but it is recommended to use ROS default messages if possible.

Messages are defined in `.msg` files located in the `msg` directory of a package.

1. To receive information about the structure of a message you can use:

```bash filename="bash"
rosmsg show [message_type]
```

2. Let's have a look at the message type used earlier (`std_msgs/String`):

```bash filename="bash" copy
rosmsg show std_msgs/String
```

The output will look something like this:

```bash filename="ouput:"
string data
```

3. In this case, the `String` message has only one variable named `data` of type `String`. This `String` message is from the `std_msgs` package and you can find it in its `msg` directory. If you want, you can view the `String.msg` file by running the following command:

```bash filename="bash" copy
roscd std_msgs/msg/
```
---
### Exercise [30 min]

- Create a launch file `move_turtlebot.launch` that starts the `homework_simulation.launch`.
- Create a publisher file called `move_turtlebot.py` that moves the simulated robot in a circle.
- Add `move_turtlebot.py` to the `move_turtlebot.launch` launch file.

Hints:

1. The `/cmd_vel` topic is the topic used to move the robot. Run `rostopic info /cmd_vel` to get information about this topic and identify the message type used.
2. To fill in the `Twist` message, you need to create an instance of the message. In Python, it goes like this: `var = Twist()`.
3. To know the structure of the `Twist` messages, you need to use the `rosmsg show` command with the message type used by the `/cmd_vel` topic.
4. In our case the robot uses a differential drive plugin to move. This means that the robot can only move linearly along the *x* axis or rotationally along the angular *z* axis. This means that the only values you need to enter in the twist message are the linear *x* and the angular *z* variables.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/ROSCoord.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={200} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>

Twist message values are in m/s, so it is recommended to use values between 0 and 1. For example, 0.5 m/s.


### Exercise Solution

1. Create a launch file `move_turtlebot.launch`.

```bash filename="bash" copy
roscd first_pkg/launch && touch move_turtlebot.launch
```

2. Paste the following code into the `move_turtlebot.launch` file:
```xml filename="xml" showLineNumbers copy
<launch>
  <include file="$(find turtlebot3_gazebo)/launch/turtlebot3_world.launch" />
    <node pkg="first_pkg" type="move_turtlebot.py" name="move_turtle_node" output="screen" />
</launch>
```

3. Create a Python file `move_turtlebot.py` in the `src` folder of the package.

```bash filename="bash" copy
roscd && cd ../src/fhtw/first_pkg/src && touch move_turtlebot.py
```
4. Make sure the script is executable:
```bash filename="bash" copy
chmod +x move_turtlebot.py
```

4. Paste the following code into the `move_turtlebot.py` file:
```python filename="python" showLineNumbers copy
#!/usr/bin/python3

import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

rospy.init_node('move_turtle_node')
pub = rospy.Publisher('/cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=1)
rate = rospy.Rate(2)
move = Twist()
move.linear.x = 0.13  # Move the robot with a linear velocity in the x axis
move.angular.z = 0.26 # Move the with an angular velocity in the z axis

while not rospy.is_shutdown():
  pub.publish(move)
  rate.sleep()
```
5. You can now start the `move_turtlebot.launch` file:

```bash filename="bash" copy
roslaunch first_pkg move_turtlebot.launch
```

**Now the robot should move in a circle!**

## Debugging

**Estimated time to completion:** 1'5 hours

**Simulated robot:** Turtlebot 3 Burger

### What will you learn with this unit?

- How can `roswtf` help you debug
- Add Debugging ROS logs to your executables
- Filter ROS logs
- Visualize connections between different nodes of your system
- Basic use of RViz debugging tool

One of the most difficult but important aspects of robotics is: `knowing how to translate your ideas and knowledge into real-world projects`.

Usually in robotics projects: *nothing works like in theory*. Reality is much more complex and therefore you need tools to figure out what is going on and where the problem is.
For this reason, debugging and visualization tools are essential and already implemented in ROS, especially when working with complex data formats like
*images, laser scans, point clouds* or *kinematic data*.

Examples are shown in the following figure:
<br/>
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/RVIz1.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={400} 
  height={300} 
/>
<Image
  src="/assets/RVIz2.jpeg" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={400} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>


## ROS Debugging Messages and RQT-Console
We have used Python's `print()` and ROS's `rospy.loginfo()` so far throughout this course without discussing the benefits/downsides.

- `print()`: Follows the Dark Lord into battle. If you use `print`, it is close to impossible to store the information you print to the ROS framework.
- `LOGS()`: The logging system of ROS allows us to print them on the screen but also to store them in the ROS framework, so we can classify, sort, filter, or else on them later.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/debug.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={200} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>


logging is provided in the rospy API

- `DEBUG`-> rospy.logdebug(msg, args)
- `INFO` -> rospy.loginfo(msg, args)
- `WARN` -> rospy.logwarn(msg, args)
- `ERROR`-> rospy.logerror(msg, args)
- `FATAL`-> rospy.logfatal(msg, args)

The ROS logging system contains *five* levels. Each level includes the deeper levels. For example, if we use the 
*Warn* level for our node, all logs from *Warn, Error, and Fatal* will be printed.

---
### Example

Let's test the different logger levels.

1. Create a new node called `logger_test.py` in the `first_pkg`:

```bash filename="bash" copy
roscd first_pkg/src && touch logger_test.py && chmod +x logger_test.py
```



```python filename="python" showLineNumbers copy
#!/usr/bin/python3

import rospy
import sys
import time

# Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
rospy.init_node('logger_test', log_level=rospy.DEBUG)
rate = rospy.Rate(0.5)

rospy.loginfo_throttle(10, "The quidditch game is at {}".format(time.time()))

while not rospy.is_shutdown():
    rospy.logdebug("You're A Wizard Harry.")
    rospy.loginfo("Doris Crockford, Mr Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last {}.".format(str(time.time())))
    rospy.logwarn("I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.")
    rospy.logerr("Dumbledore will only leave from Hogwarts when there are none loyal to him!")
    rospy.logfatal("Dobby didn't mean to kill anyone. Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure")
    rate.sleep()
    rospy.logfatal("END")
```

2. Start a `roscore` in a terminal if it is not already running:
```bash filename="bash" copy
roscore
```
3. Make a new Terminal with `[ctrl + b] and [Shift + 5]` and start the `logger_test.py` node in a new terminal:
```bash filename="bash" copy
rosrun first_pkg logger_test.py
```
The output will look something like this:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/LogInfo.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={800} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>

---
### Exercise [5 min]

Adapt the log level of the `logger_test.py` and inspect the output of the topic `/rosout` using `rostopic echo`.

1. Copy the following code into the `logger_test.py` file:
```python filename="python" showLineNumbers copy
#!/usr/bin/python3

import rospy
import sys
import time

log_dict = {
    "DEBUG": rospy.DEBUG,
    "INFO": rospy.INFO,
    "WARN": rospy.WARN,
    "ERROR": rospy.ERROR,
    "FATAL": rospy.FATAL,
}

# Check if a log level argument was provided and if it's valid
if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] in log_dict:
    log_level = sys.argv[1]  # Use the provided valid log level
    LOGGER = log_dict[log_level]  # Get the corresponding ROS log level constant
else:
    log_level = "DEBUG"  # Default to "DEBUG" if no valid argument is provided
    LOGGER = rospy.DEBUG  # Set the log level to rospy.DEBUG as a fallback
 
rospy.init_node('logger_test', log_level=LOGGER)    # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
rate = rospy.Rate(0.5)

rospy.loginfo_throttle(10, f"The quidditch game is at {time.time()}")

while not rospy.is_shutdown():
    rospy.logdebug("You're A Wizard Harry.")
    rospy.loginfo(f"Doris Crockford, Mr Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last {str(time.time())}.")
    rospy.logwarn("I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.")
    rospy.logerr("Dumbledore will only leave from Hogwarts when there are none loyal to him!")
    rospy.logfatal(f"Dobby didn't mean to kill anyone.\nDobby only meant to maim or seriously injure")
    rate.sleep()
```


2. Add the `logger_test.py` to the `move_turtlebot.launch` file.

```xml filename="xml" showLineNumbers copy
<launch>
    <include file="$(find turtlebot3_gazebo)/launch/turtlebot3_world.launch" />
    <node pkg="first_pkg" type="move_turtlebot.py" name="move_turtle_node" output="screen" />
    <node pkg="first_pkg" type="logger_test.py" name="logger_test_node" output="screen" />
</launch>
```

3. Start the `move_turtlebot.launch` file again.
```bash filename="bash" copy
roslaunch first_pkg move_turtlebot.launch
```

4. Open another Terminal with `[ctrl + b] and [Shift + 2]`Inspect the topic `/rosout` again starting the `move_turtlebot.launch` file.
```bash filename="bash" copy  
rostopic echo /rosout
```


As you have seen in the first part of the exercise, the amount of data is already large. On the third part of the exercise, with only 6 running nodes, `/rosout` was already really hard to follow.

Now imagine ten nodes publishing image data, laser data, using actions, services or performing computations and publishing debug data from your Deep Learning node.

**It is really hard to get the logging data you want.**

This is where `rqt_console` comes in handy.

## RQT Console

1. Start the launch file `move_turtlebot.launch` with the modified `logger_test.py`:

```bash filename="bash" copy
roslaunch first_pkg move_turtlebot.launch
```

2. Start the `rqt_console`:

```bash filename="bash" copy
rqt_console
```
<br/>
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/RQT_Console.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={800} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>

The `rqt_console` window is divided into three subpanels.

1. The first panel outputs the logs. It contains data about the message, the severity/level, the node generating that message, and other data. This is where all your log data is extracted.
2. The second one allows you to filter the messages output in the first window by excluding them according to criteria such as node, severity level, or that they contain a certain word. To add a filter, simply press the plus sign and select the one you want.
3. In the third field, you can highlight certain messages while the others are displayed.

You also need to know that by clicking on the small white gear in the upper right corner, you can change the number of messages displayed. Try to keep it as low as possible to avoid performance degradation in your system. Further, using the small white gear it is also possible to set the `log level` of already running nodes.
<br/>

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/RQT_Console2.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={800} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>

## RQT Plot

This is a very common need in any scientific discipline, but especially important in robotics. You need to know if your tilt is correct, your velocity is the right one, 
the torque values in an arm joint are above normal, or the laser has anomalous readings. For all these different msg types, you need a graphical tool that can quickly 
process all the data you receive in real time. This is where `rqt_plot` comes in handy.
<br/>
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/RQT_plot.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={800} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>

In the topic input located in the top-left corner of the window, you have to write the topic structure that leads to the data that you want to plot. Bear in mind that in order to be plotted, the topic has to publish a number. Once written, you press the PLUS SIGN to start plotting the Topic. In the case that we want to plot the robot joints, we need to plot the topic `/joint_states`, which has the following structure:

```bash filename="bash" copy
rosmsg show sensor_msgs/JointState
```
  
```bash filename="output:"
  std_msgs/Header header
  uint32 seq
  time stamp
  string frame_id
string[] name
float64[] position
float64[] velocity
float64[] effort
```

## RQT Graph: Visualizing Node Connections

Is your node connected to the right topics? Why are you not receiving msgs from a topic? 
These questions are quite common when developing ROS systems. `rqt_graph` can help you find 
that out more easily. It displays a visual diagram of the nodes running in ROS and their topic connections.

1. Start `rqt_graph`:

```bash filename="bash" copy
rqt_graph
```
<br/>
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/RQT_Graph.png" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={800} 
  height={300} 
/>

</div>

In the figure, you are presented with all of the currently running nodes, connected by the topics they use to communicate with each other (publish/subscribe). There are two main elements

 that you need to know how to use:

1. The *refresh button*: Which you have to press any time you have changed the nodes that are running.
2. The *filtering options*: These are the three boxes just beside the refresh button. The first element lets you select between only nodes or topics. The second box allows you to filter by names of nodes.

## RViz

And here you have it. The HollyMolly! The Firebolt broom, the Cloak of Invisibility! The most important tool for ROS debugging....

<GlowingText style={{ fontSize: '3rem' }}>RViz</GlowingText>

RVIZ is a tool that allows you to visualize images, PointClouds, 2D lasers, kinematic transformations, RobotModels, IMU readings, RGBD PointClouds, etc. You can even define your own markers. This is one of the reasons why ROS has been so widely accepted. Before RVIZ, it was really difficult to know what the robot was perceiving. And that is the main concept:

RVIZ is **NOT** a simulation. I repeat: it is **NOT** a simulation.

RVIZ is a representation of what is published in the topics, by the simulation or the real robot.

RVIZ is a really complex tool and it would take you a whole course just to master it. Here, you will get a glimpse of what it can give you.

### Example

1. Make sure the `roscore` is running in a terminal:
```bash filename="bash" copy
roscore
```

2. Start RVIZ in a new terminal `[ctrl + b] and [Shift + 5]`:

```bash filename="bash" copy
rosrun rviz rviz
```
or simply type `rviz` in the terminal.
```bash filename="bash" copy
rviz
```

Add stuff that should be displayed as visualized in the video.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<Image
  src="/assets/RVIZ.gif" 
  alt="File System" 
  width={800} 
  height={300} 
/>
</div>
As shown in the figure, we can save the just created display configuration to a specific file, so we can load it using a launch file or the command line with `rosrun rviz rviz -d <path-to-config.rviz>`.

---
### Homework [5 Points]

- Adapt the `move_turtlebot.launch` file so that it starts RVIZ with the following topics visualized:
  - The Robot model
  - All coordinate frames (TFs) of the robot without their names
  - The 2D laser scan topic
- Create a Python file `unit2_hw.py` that subscribes to the robot's odometry and laser scan topic, performing the following:
  - `[odometry]`: Log the odometry message to DEBUG
  - `[scan]`: Publish the 5 closest points of each sensor reading as `std_msg/Float32MultiArray` on the topic `n_smallest`

**Hints:**

- Load the RVIZ display-config by providing arguments to the node in the launch file
- Use the [substitution arg `find` or `dirname`](https://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML#substitution_args) to get the *relative path* of the RVIZ config file.
- Convert the variable that holds the ranges of the laser scan data to a numpy array to ease computation

`std_msg/Float32MultiArray` can be declared as below:

```python filename="python" showLineNumbers copy
from std_msgs.msg import Float32MultiArray
from numpy import asarray

# Option A
msg = Float32MultiArray(data=[20, 30, 4, 22, 16])

# Option B
array = asarray([20, 30, 4, 22, 16])
msg = Float32MultiArray(data=array)
```
